BASE CODE from: gc studio, Danki Code's teacher
models and code: myself
inspirated by: Minecraft

I am a student, so... don't expect too much from me.

DAY 1
I've created the base mechanic, now i can put blocks, but i'm not sure if it's ok...like, i can literally put another block in the first. lol

DAY 2
Too much stuffs today, so i just remake some sprites and draw a chicken and some mechanics that i want to do. 
                 ps.: i don't even know if i can program this lmao

DAY 3
How? idk, i just have tried a lot of stuffs that i remembered, but didn't work (like everything on my life).
Soo, f ck this heart system, i'm going to ask AI to do this for me and try to learn something about the code itself.
